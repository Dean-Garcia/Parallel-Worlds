# Parallel-Worlds

Creates a map with several identical surfaces ('worlds') using the starting seed. Portal gates can be used to transverse between the worlds quickly. Materials/fluids/power can also be transferred between worlds. Each player will be placed on their own force and thus research is separate for each player.

Danacus's Surfaces series mods were used as the basis for this mod.

A set of gates are spawned in on the starting surface to be picked up and placed in the various worlds. The starting set do not work until picked up and placed.

Use "to" gates to establish a connection between the worlds for transportation. If you need to pick up things, try to pick up the 'to' gates. I'd recommend destroying any arrival/receiver items you pick up.

You can see a playthrough of this mod on my twitch channel twitch.tv/wolfs_hollow. VOD 1 is at https://www.twitch.tv/videos/979545071

If you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them. Thanks!
